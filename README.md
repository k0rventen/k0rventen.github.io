# blog

src for my blog/site using [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

the src is in the main branch, and each commit triggers the rendering of the site in the gh-pages branch, on which Github Pages points.

uses the [hello-friend theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend). 

to generate locally, run either `hugo server` and go to localhost:1313, or `hugo` and check the public folder.
