I'm coco (aka k0rventen), 24 yo IT engineer.

Currently working on _everything_ orbiting around kubernetes.

As I don't have a very good memory, I needed a place to put various projects and works that i've already done inside them, so that i won't have to reinvent the wheel each time a similar situation arise.

But it's also a way of sharing my ideas, solutions etc so that maybe one day it might help someone.
