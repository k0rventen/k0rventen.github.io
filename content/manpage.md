I'm coco (aka k0rventen), 24 yo IT engineer.

Currently working on _everything_ orbiting around kubernetes.

As i don't have a very good memory, I need a place to put various projects and works that i've already done, so that i don't forget them and won't have to reinvent the wheel each time.

But it's also a way of sharing my ideas, solutions etc so that maybe one day it might help someone.

You can contact me at corentin at farque dot net.
