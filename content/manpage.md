I'm coco (aka k0rventen), 27 yo IT engineer.

Hot topics for me right now are kubernetes, devops & software supply chain.

As I don't have a very good memory, this is a place for me to put projects and important or tedious things that I've done, so that I won't have to reinvent the wheel each time a similar situation arise.

But it's also a way of sharing my ideas, solutions etc so that maybe one day it might help someone (hi future self).
